== Frequently asked questions ==

= A question that someone might have =

Where is my data going?

Your web site content is being formatted in XML so that the iPhone app can read it.  The iPhone app will be able to read the XML and store that information in your iOS device, making it easy to access and modify from your iPhone or iPad.

Do you collect any data?

Currently we do not collect any data from sites.  We do plan to track usage, but not collect data.

Can someone else get to my data?

No more than they can by visiting your web site.  you can see all of the data that is presented in the XML docment on your site by navigating to the Dashboard > Settings > PhotoLDR, then clicking the XML data link at the top of that screen.
